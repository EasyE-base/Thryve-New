The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Thryve fitness platform from an MVP to a feature-rich application. Key initial achievements included resolving authentication issues by migrating to Firebase Auth, establishing a premium UI, and developing comprehensive dashboards for customers, merchants, and instructors, alongside a functional Stripe payment system and marketplace. A critical step involved rectifying Kubernetes ingress routing for  endpoints by introducing a  proxy, centralizing all backend logic there. The business model for class creation was also corrected, moving from instructors to studios. Subsequent major efforts focused on implementing complex business logic, including no-show fees, Thryve X Pass, and various pricing models. Immediately prior to this summary, the engineer finalized and fully tested the parallel implementation of the notification, analytics, and file upload systems. Following this, significant work was done on the Instructor Staffing & Shift Swap System, with backend APIs and frontend components integrated, though frontend testing revealed an authentication flow issue. Most recently, the AI-Powered Recommendation Engine was fully implemented and tested, overcoming OpenAI API key and database connection issues. The engineer has now begun work on the revolutionary AI Studio Onboarding & Growth Assistant, starting with the Smart Data Importer.

The Thryve project aims to be a multi-role fitness platform (Customer, Instructor, Merchant) providing a seamless user experience. The core problem was establishing a robust, scalable platform. The application uses Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Firebase Auth for stability. Key business logic includes No-Show/Late Cancellation Fee Logic, Thryve X Pass multi-studio credit system, diverse Pricing Model Logic (transaction fees, business tiers), and Unlimited Product Billing Cycle Logic allowing extended bookings. Recently requested features include the **Instructor Staffing & Schedule Management** system, enabling shift coverage, real-time communication, and instructor swaps with optional studio approval and conflict detection. The latest vision is the **AI Studio Onboarding & Growth Assistant**, a game-changing system designed to eliminate onboarding friction and provide intelligent, real-time growth recommendations. This includes an AI-powered data importer for seamless migration, an AI configuration wizard for quick setup, an AI-driven website builder, customer migration intelligence, an ongoing AI growth coach, and AI-powered class optimization.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the Full-Featured Parallel Implementation strategy, successfully completing and fully testing the **File Upload System**, **Notification System**, and **Analytics Dashboard**. This involved creating , ensuring  and  were functional, and adding/correcting corresponding API endpoints in . A new test page, , was created to showcase these integrated systems. Backend testing passed 100%, and frontend testing also completed successfully.

Following this, work commenced on the **Instructor Staffing & Schedule Management System**. Backend APIs for swap requests, coverage management, chat, and settings were added to . Frontend components , , and  were created and integrated into the instructor and merchant dashboards, including new Staffing tabs. Backend testing achieved a 78.6% pass rate, with core functionality working. Frontend testing revealed a critical authentication flow issue preventing complete end-to-end verification.

The next major focus shifted to the **AI-Powered Recommendation Engine**. This involved installing the  dependency, creating  for the client, and  for the service logic. New API endpoints were added to . Frontend components  and  were created, along with a dedicated . Initial backend testing identified an issue with the OpenAI API key not being loaded, which was resolved by ensuring the  file was correctly read and by obtaining a new, valid API key from the user. A  import error in  was also fixed. The AI-Powered Recommendation Engine is now fully functional, including class recommendations, natural language search, instructor matching, and workout plan generation, confirmed by 84.6% backend test success.

The current work in progress is the **AI Studio Onboarding & Growth Assistant**. The immediate task chosen is the **Smart Data Importer**. The AI engineer has already created the backend service  and added its API endpoints to . The frontend UI component, , has also been created.
