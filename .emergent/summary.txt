The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Thryve fitness platform from an initial MVP into a feature-rich, visually stunning application. Key achievements include resolving critical authentication issues by migrating from Supabase/NextAuth.js to Firebase Auth, a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul to achieve a billion-dollar aesthetic with consistent gradients, glassmorphism, and rounded elements, and the robust implementation of Customer, Merchant, and Instructor dashboards. Significant milestones achieved in the trajectory include the development of a full-fledged Marketplace with advanced search and filtering, the creation of comprehensive Class Detail Pages with an integrated booking flow, and the complete implementation and successful testing of a real Stripe payment system. Most recently, the focus shifted to building the My Bookings management system, with backend functionality for booking retrieval, cancellation, and check-in successfully implemented and tested. The work demonstrates a strong emphasis on user experience, professional design, and robust frontend and backend architecture.

The Thryve project is envisioned as a multi-role fitness platform for Customers, Instructors, and Merchants, aiming to provide a seamless experience from user discovery to class booking and payment. The core problem is to establish a robust, scalable platform with distinct user journeys for each role. The Aha Moment is defined as a customer signing up, selecting a role, onboarding, successfully booking and paying for a class via Stripe, and the instructor receiving payment. The application uses Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Historically, authentication stability was a major concern, leading to the adoption of Firebase Auth to resolve issues like black screens and redirect loops. The overarching goal has been to deliver a production-ready application with a premium, billion-dollar UI/UX. So far, Firebase integration is stable, all key dashboards, a marketplace, comprehensive class detail pages, and a full Stripe payment flow are implemented and functionally tested. The UI has undergone a significant overhaul to be mobile-first, rounded, and animated.

-   : The central landing page, previously refactored for Firebase authentication and redesigned for a premium aesthetic, including correct external navigation links and authentication modal triggers. Recently re-designed for a modern, mobile-first aesthetic with gradients and rounded elements.
-   : The instructor marketplace. This file was completely rewritten to implement a modern, mobile-first swipeable version, featuring a new search bar, advanced filter sidebar, and professional instructor preview cards with rounded buttons and enhanced UI/UX.
-   : The dynamic class detail page. This file was significantly enhanced to include comprehensive class features, real API integration for details, and the full booking flow with session selection, pricing display, and integration with Stripe checkout. It was updated multiple times for content and booking functionality.
-   : The primary Next.js API route handler. This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development.
    -   It was updated to include GET endpoints for individual classes (e.g., ).
    -   Firebase authentication functions (, ) were re-added/ensured to be present.
    -   Crucially, new Stripe-related endpoints were added or enhanced:  for creating Stripe checkout sessions and  for fetching booking details post-payment.
    -   The Stripe webhook handler was updated to process  events and mark bookings as completed.
    -   Most recently, it was enhanced with  for fetching user-specific bookings,  for cancelling bookings, and  for managing check-ins, all integrated with MongoDB.
-   : Contains the Stripe client initialization and helper functions. It was updated to ensure correct usage of environment variables for Stripe keys (, ).
-   : A new page created to display booking confirmation details after a successful payment.
-   : A new page created to handle booking cancellations or payment failures.
-   : A newly created page to serve as the user's booking management dashboard, showing upcoming and past classes with options for cancellation and check-in. This file is currently being integrated with the new backend APIs.
-   : The global CSS file. It was completely replaced with modern, mobile-first styles to establish the new design language, including custom gradients, rounded elements, and animations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the My Bookings management system, which is part of the Complete the User Journey objective.

The work currently in progress includes:
1.  **My Bookings Page Creation**: A new page  was created to serve as the user's personal dashboard for managing their class bookings. This page is designed to display upcoming classes, booking history, and provide functionalities like cancellation and check-in.
2.  **Backend API Enhancements for Bookings Management**: The main API route handler () has been significantly expanded to support the My Bookings features. This includes:
    *   **GET /api/bookings**: An endpoint to fetch all bookings associated with a logged-in user.
    *   **POST /api/bookings/cancel**: An endpoint to handle the cancellation of a specific booking, updating its status in the MongoDB database.
    *   **POST /api/bookings/check-in**: An endpoint to record a user's check-in for a class, updating the booking status.
    *   These backend functions are designed to interact with MongoDB collections for bookings and classes, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates for the user.
3.  **Frontend Integration with Backend**: The  file is actively being updated to integrate with these newly created backend APIs. The frontend code is being modified to fetch real booking data and handle user actions (like cancelling or checking in) by making calls to the respective API endpoints.
4.  **Backend Testing**: The last action taken was initiating the backend testing for the My Bookings system to ensure that the newly implemented API endpoints (, , ) are functioning correctly and interacting with the database as expected.
