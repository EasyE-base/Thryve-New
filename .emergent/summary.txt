<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully evolved the Thryve fitness platform from an MVP to a robust, feature-rich application. Initial efforts focused on resolving critical authentication issues by migrating to Firebase Auth and implementing a premium UI/UX. The development then progressed through comprehensive dashboard creation (Customer, Merchant, Instructor), a marketplace, class detail pages, and a functional Stripe payment system. A significant phase involved building and testing the My Bookings system, including backend APIs and frontend integration. Crucially, the engineer identified and resolved a Kubernetes ingress routing issue for  endpoints by implementing a  proxy. Following this, the business model for class creation was corrected, moving it from instructors to studios/merchants. The final major phase involved implementing advanced business logic for no-show fees, Thryve X Pass, and pricing models, along with core backend and initial frontend components. The engineer is currently working on a parallel implementation of notification, analytics, and file upload systems, demonstrating iterative development and adaptability to user feedback.

The Thryve project aims to be a multi-role fitness platform (Customer, Instructor, Merchant) providing seamless user experience from discovery to booking and payment. The core problem was establishing a robust, scalable platform with distinct user journeys, with the Aha Moment being a customer successfully booking and paying via Stripe. The application uses Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Firebase Auth was adopted to resolve prior authentication stability issues. The UI/UX was revamped for a premium, mobile-first aesthetic with gradients and rounded elements.

Key business logic includes:
- **No-Show/Late Cancellation Fee Logic**: Deducting class credits and/or applying fees based on membership type (Class Pack vs. Unlimited Membership) for missed classes, with configurable admin settings (cancellation window, grace period, fee amount).
- **Thryve X Pass System**: A multi-studio credit system where users purchase packs (5/10/15 credits) redeemable at any participating studio. Thryve takes a 5-10% flat booking fee at redemption. Studios can opt-in and tag eligible classes.
- **Pricing Model Logic**: A 3.75% core platform transaction fee on all transactions, plus specific business plan tiers (Starter, Business+, Enterprise) and a Thryve Member+ model with a flat 5% fee for studios.
- **Unlimited Product Billing Cycle Logic**: Allows bookings up to 30 days past the billing cycle for unlimited monthly auto-pay products to overcome typical booking restrictions.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a Next.js 14 App Router architecture, supporting multiple user roles and a modular feature set.



-   : The original primary Next.js API route handler. It has been extensively modified for various functionalities (Stripe, bookings). Its primary importance was as the central API, but it became problematic due to Kubernetes ingress routing issues for  prefix, leading to the creation of .
-   : **NEW FILE**. Created as a server-side API proxy to bypass Kubernetes ingress issues causing 502 errors for  routes. This file now handles all backend API logic for authentication, bookings, Stripe Connect, instructor/studio class management, and advanced business logic (XPass, no-show fees). It's critical for the application's external functionality. Changes involved adding various GET and POST handlers for , , , , , , and business logic endpoints like , , , . Database connection issues were also resolved here.
-   : Contains Firebase authentication helper functions. Modified to update API calls from  to  for  and  to ensure authentication functions work via the external URL.
-   : The user's booking management dashboard. Initially created for displaying and managing bookings. Modified to fetch real booking data and handle user actions (cancel/check-in) using the new  endpoints. Also enhanced to improve authentication state persistence and loading indicators.
-   : The customer onboarding page. Modified to use  for onboarding completion to resolve prior 502 errors and improve redirect logic and localStorage persistence for role data.
-   : The instructor dashboard. Initially had placeholder coming soon content and incorrectly allowed instructors to create classes. Significantly modified to:
    *   Integrate Stripe Connect functionality (earnings, payouts).
    *   Remove class creation capability.
    *   Show My Assigned Classes by studios using .
    *   Resolved  variable errors.
    *   Added  import for UI elements.
-   : The merchant dashboard. Modified to include a Classes section in the navigation and integrate class management functionality, including studio-specific class creation.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Created specifically for studios/merchants to create classes, aligning with the corrected business model. It includes a comprehensive class creation form with instructor assignment.
-   : **NEW FILE**. A React component created to provide a button for instructors to connect their Stripe accounts.
-   : **NEW FILE**. A React component for studios to manage their X Pass settings, cancellation policies, and view pricing model transparency.
-   : **NEW FILE**. A React component for customers to purchase X Pass credits with different package options and displays credit balance.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Placeholder component created for future analytics features.
-   : **NEW FILE**. Placeholder component created for future notification features.

<pending_tasks>
- Advanced calendar integration (e.g., Google Calendar sync).
- File upload functionality for user profiles and class images (currently in parallel implementation).
- Full completion of the onboarding logic for all roles beyond basic profile updates (customer onboarding done, others pending).
- Integration of Watch Demo button with actual video content.
- Real-time Updates (notifications, calendar changes, data persistence - notifications in parallel implementation).
- Advanced Features: Video Streaming, AI Recommendations, Advanced Search (AI recommendations in parallel implementation).
- Platform Management: Admin Panel, Support System, Content Management (Admin Panel in proposed next steps).
- Frontend integration and testing for File Upload system, Notification system, and Analytics dashboard (currently in progress).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing advanced business features, specifically focusing on the full specification document provided by the user. This encompassed:
1.  **No-Show / Late Cancellation Fee Logic**: Implementing rules for deducting credits and applying fees based on membership type (Class Pack vs. Unlimited) and studio-defined configurable settings.
2.  **Thryve X Pass System**: Building the system for multi-studio class redemption where users purchase credit packs, studios opt-in, and Thryve collects a flat booking fee.
3.  **Pricing Model Logic**: Incorporating a 3.75% core platform transaction fee, defining business plan tiers (Starter, Business+, Enterprise), and a Thryve Member+ model with a 5% studio fee.
4.  **Unlimited Product Billing Cycle Logic**: Allowing bookings for unlimited auto-pay products up to 30 days past the billing cycle.

The implementation involved creating core business models, adding new API endpoints to the  file for user payment/credit systems, X Pass purchases, no-show penalties, and studio business configuration. It also included creating new frontend components:
-   : For studio management of X Pass and pricing.
-   : For customer X Pass credit purchases.

Backend testing for all these business logic APIs (, , , ) was successfully completed with 100% test pass rate. Frontend testing of  and  components was also completed successfully, confirming their functionality and integration.

The current work context also includes the recent shift to a Full-Featured Parallel Implementation strategy for **Notification System**, **Analytics Dashboard**, and **File Upload System**. The engineer has already started this by modifying  for file upload handling and adding POST endpoints for notifications and analytics. New frontend components have been created: , , and the next step is creating the file upload component.
