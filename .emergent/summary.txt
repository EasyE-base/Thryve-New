The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Thryve fitness platform from initial setup to a feature-rich application. The primary focus initially was to resolve critical authentication issues, migrating from Supabase/NextAuth.js to Firebase Auth, including robust error handling and client-side fallbacks for Kubernetes 502 errors. This also involved a significant UI/UX overhaul to achieve a billion-dollar company aesthetic, applying consistent gradients, glassmorphism, and ensuring all landing page and dashboard buttons were functional. Subsequently, the engineer meticulously implemented comprehensive Customer, Merchant, and Instructor dashboards with detailed features and professional designs, leveraging  and . The final major task completed before this summary was the development of a full-fledged Marketplace page, enabling instructor discovery with advanced search and filtering. The work demonstrates a strong emphasis on a polished user experience and robust frontend architecture, although the backend integration for newly added features remains pending.

<product_requirements>
The Thryve project aims to be a multi-role fitness platform for Customers, Instructors, and Merchants, featuring role-based authentication, distinct onboarding processes, and dedicated dashboards. The core Aha Moment is a customer signing up, selecting a role, onboarding, booking a class via Stripe, and an instructor receiving payment. The platform utilizes Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Historically, authentication was problematic, leading to a pivot through Supabase, NextAuth.js, custom simple auth, and most recently, Firebase Auth to fix issues like black screens and redirect loops. The primary objective has been to finalize Firebase integration, ensure dashboard functionality, and elevate the UI to a premium, billion-dollar aesthetic, creating a production-ready application.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a significant phase focused on enhancing the Thryve application's core user experience and expanding its feature set, following the user's directive to prioritize the booking flow.

The most recent work includes:
1.  **Comprehensive Dashboard Overhauls:**
    *   **Customer Dashboard ():** Redesigned with a sidebar navigation. Includes an overview panel with KPI cards (Classes Booked This Week, Upcoming Classes, Total Classes Attended, Loyalty Points), an interactive calendar using  (color-coded events, month/week toggles), an activity analytics section with  (bar, pie, line charts for attendance), My Favorites (studios/instructors), and a notifications panel.
    *   **Merchant Dashboard ():** Implemented with a sidebar layout. Features top KPI cards (Total Revenue, Total Bookings, New Clients, Class Utilization, Cancelation Rate), quick actions, a dynamic drag-and-drop class calendar, advanced analytics (Revenue Trends, Class Fill Rates, Client Retention, Booking Heatmap), client management, instructor/staff management, payments/financials, packages/memberships manager, settings, and a placeholder for AI tools.
    *   **Instructor Dashboard ():** Developed with a sidebar. Includes a welcome greeting, upcoming classes widget, daily checklist, a comprehensive schedule/calendar view, class management (roster, check-in), instructor performance dashboard, client engagement tools (direct messages), earnings overview, and settings/profile management.
