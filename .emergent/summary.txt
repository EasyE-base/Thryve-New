The previous AI engineer's work primarily revolved around establishing a robust multi-role authentication system for the Thryve fitness platform. Initially, the project used Supabase, but persistent  and  errors led to a shift. The AI engineer attempted to resolve these by simplifying Supabase client configuration, but when user-reported issues (redirect loops, black screens) persisted despite automated tests showing success, a pivot to NextAuth.js was made.

The NextAuth.js implementation, while initially showing promise in automated tests, also failed to satisfy the user, leading to a simple session-based auth approach. This, too, proved problematic due to MongoDB imports in client-side code. After extensive debugging and multiple iterations, the user's continued dissatisfaction prompted a re-evaluation of the authentication strategy. The final pivot, as per the user's explicit request, is to implement Firebase Auth, which is currently underway. The trajectory highlights a recurring challenge: discrepancy between automated test results and the user's real-world experience, leading to multiple shifts in the core authentication architecture.

The Thryve project aims to be a multi-role fitness platform enabling Customers, Instructors, and Merchants to interact. Key features include role-based authentication, a guided step-by-step onboarding process unique to each role, and dedicated dashboards. Core functionalities will encompass class booking, facilitated by Stripe for payments, and an instructor marketplace. The platform is built using Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS for UI, and historically utilized Supabase for authentication and PostgreSQL, with Stripe for payments (Connect & Elements). Other technologies include Zustand for state management, react-hook-form for forms, and react-big-calendar for scheduling. The Aha Moment flow involves a customer signing up, selecting a role, completing onboarding, booking a class, and an instructor getting paid. Implementation has focused on establishing the multi-role authentication flow (signup, role selection), and basic onboarding/dashboard scaffolding, with initial Supabase and Stripe integration attempts. The authentication method has seen multiple pivots from Supabase, to NextAuth.js, to a simple custom auth, and now to Firebase Auth, to resolve persistent issues.

- Next.js 14 (App Router, Server/Client Components, API Routes, Middleware)
- Supabase (Initial Auth & PostgreSQL)
- NextAuth.js (Attempted authentication solution)
- Firebase Auth (Current authentication solution)
- MongoDB (Database for user data and application data)
- Stripe (Connect & Elements for payments)
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui for frontend styling
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application follows a Next.js 14 App Router architecture.



**Key Files and Modifications:**

-   : Originally for Supabase role-based routing. Its status is ambiguous after multiple auth rewrites; likely deprecated or needs re-evaluation for Firebase.
-   : Initialized Supabase client. Was frequently modified for session handling and SSR issues, but now largely deprecated due to the switch to Firebase.
-   : Contained core Supabase authentication functions. It was iteratively modified for NextAuth and simple auth, and its current relevance depends on its integration with the new Firebase system.
-   : Central API route for MongoDB connections and initial generic API endpoints. Its functions for auth (e.g., ) have been superseded by specific auth API routes.
-   : The main application page. Underwent significant refactoring to integrate and adapt to Supabase, then NextAuth, then a custom simple auth, and now Firebase authentication flows for signup, login, and role selection.
-   : Originally a dedicated role selection page. Its functionality was integrated into  and later updated to remove MongoDB imports for client-side use.
-   , , : Dashboard pages for each role. These were updated to remove MongoDB imports, relying on client-side auth instead.
-   : Onboarding form for customers. Was updated multiple times to correctly handle session checks and profile completion with the changing authentication backends (Supabase, NextAuth, Simple Auth).
-    (now ): A client-side React Context provider. Initially introduced for NextAuth session management and will now be adapted for Firebase.
-   : Updated to include Supabase and Stripe API keys, and more recently,  (now deprecated) and Firebase config keys.
-   : Updated with , ,  (deprecated), and now .
-    and : Created for NextAuth.js implementation, now deprecated following the pivot away from NextAuth.
-   , , , : Created for the simple authentication attempt, now deprecated for Firebase.
-   : **NEW** file to initialize the Firebase app using provided configuration.
-   : **NEW** file containing authentication helper functions for Firebase (e.g., signup, signin, getting current user, updating roles).
-   : **NEW** API endpoint for managing user roles in MongoDB via Firebase authentication.
-   : **NEW** API endpoint for managing additional user data in MongoDB via Firebase authentication.

<pending_tasks>
- Full Stripe Connect integration for instructor payouts and merchant accounts.
- Implementation of the instructor marketplace.
- Advanced calendar integration using .
- File upload functionality for user profiles and class images.
- Full completion of the onboarding logic for all roles, beyond basic profile updates.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on integrating Firebase Auth as the primary authentication system, replacing the previously problematic Supabase and NextAuth.js implementations. The AI engineer has just completed the initial setup steps for Firebase:

1.  **Dependencies Installation**:  package has been added to  and installed via yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
success Already up-to-date.
Done in 1.41s..
2.  **Firebase Configuration File Creation**: A new file, , has been created. This file is responsible for initializing the Firebase application using the  keys (, , , etc.) provided by the user.
3.  **Firebase Authentication Helpers Creation**: A new file, , has been created. This file will house functions to interact with Firebase Authentication, such as , , and potentially .
4.  **Firebase API Endpoints Creation**: Two new API routes have been created under :
    *   : Expected to handle server-side updates of user roles in MongoDB, authenticated via Firebase.
    *   : Expected to handle other user-related data management in MongoDB, authenticated via Firebase.
5.  **Main Page Update**: The  file has been modified to incorporate Firebase authentication logic, replacing the previous simple auth or NextAuth logic for user signup, sign-in, and initial role selection.

The current state is that the Firebase setup is code-complete for the core authentication and initial role management, and the AI engineer's very next step is to test this new Firebase implementation to ensure it resolves the persistent black screen and redirect issues reported by the user.
