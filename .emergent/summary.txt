The previous AI engineer was tasked with building a multi-role fitness platform named Thryve, from zero to one. The project relies on Next.js 14, Supabase for authentication and database, and Stripe for payments. The initial plan focused on setting up integrations and then building core features like class booking and role-based authentication.

A significant portion of the trajectory has been consumed by persistent issues related to Supabase authentication and session management. The AI engineer attempted various fixes, including client-side session handling, server-side API endpoints for role selection, and even temporarily bypassing Supabase user metadata by storing roles in  or MongoDB. However, these attempts either introduced new problems (e.g., 404s, JavaScript errors) or were deemed unsuitable for production. The user provided a revised authentication flow which the AI engineer implemented. Still, critical errors, specifically  and , indicate fundamental Supabase SSR configuration conflicts, leading to the application failing to load correctly. The engineer is currently trying to simplify the Supabase client to resolve these.

<product_requirements>
The Thryve project aims to be a multi-role fitness platform featuring role-based authentication (Customer, Instructor, Merchant), guided step-by-step onboarding, and distinct dashboards for each role. Core functionalities include class booking with Stripe payments, and an instructor marketplace. The platform is built with Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Supabase for authentication and PostgreSQL database, and Stripe for payments (Connect & Elements). Other key technologies include Zustand for state management,  for forms, and  for scheduling. The Aha Moment flow involves a customer signing up, selecting a role, completing onboarding, finding and booking a class, and an instructor getting paid. The implementation has so far focused on establishing the multi-role authentication flow, including signup, role selection, and basic onboarding and dashboard pages for all user types, alongside initial Supabase and Stripe integration scaffolding.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Next.js 14 (App Router, Server/Client Components, API Routes, Middleware)
- Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, ,  for session management)
- Stripe (Connect & Elements for payments and payouts)
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui for frontend styling
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via user metadata
- Session persistence and handling in a full-stack Next.js environment

The application follows a structured Next.js 14 App Router architecture, focusing on clear separation of concerns:



**Key Files and Modifications:**

-    (initially ): Responsible for role-based protected routing and session management. It uses  from Supabase to redirect users based on their authentication status and role. It was temporarily removed during debugging due to conflict with Supabase SSR, and a more robust version was conceptually provided by the user (Chat 301) for better session handling.
-   : Initializes the Supabase client. This file was frequently modified to configure session persistence (, , ) and adapt to client-side vs. server-side cookie handling (e.g.,  helper). Its current state is an attempt to simplify its configuration to resolve SSR errors.
-   : Contains core authentication functions like , , , , and . This file underwent numerous iterations to simplify signup, ensure immediate sign-in post-signup, and correctly handle user session and role updates (both client-side and via server-side API).
-   : The central API route handler. It manages various backend endpoints including  and . It was modified extensively to handle user authentication checks, process role selections (initially targeting Supabase user metadata, then a temporary MongoDB storage, then back to Supabase metadata via server-side API), and debug session issues.
-   : The main application page, handling user signup, login, and dynamically integrated role selection. It was heavily refactored to embed role selection directly, eliminating redirect loops, and to integrate session management/error display.
-   : Initially a dedicated page for role selection. Its functionality was integrated into  to simplify the flow and address session redirect issues.
-   : A shared layout for all dashboards, redirecting unauthenticated users or those who haven't completed onboarding.
-   , , : These are the specific dashboard pages for each role. Only the customer dashboard was initially created; the instructor and merchant dashboards were later added to resolve 404 errors.
-   , , : Onboarding forms for each role. The customer onboarding was the first; instructor and merchant onboarding pages were created later to fix 404 errors upon role selection and redirection. They handle user profile updates and marking onboarding as complete.
-   : A client-side React Context provider for global session management, introduced as part of the user-suggested authentication flow (Chat 301).
-   : Updated to include all Supabase and Stripe API keys provided by the user.
-   : Updated with necessary dependencies like Supabase client libraries, , Stripe, and UI components.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Full Stripe Connect integration for instructor payouts and merchant accounts.
- Implementation of the instructor marketplace.
- Advanced calendar integration using .
- File upload functionality for user profiles and class images.
- Full completion of the onboarding logic for all roles, beyond basic profile updates.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving critical, persistent Supabase authentication and session management errors. Despite numerous iterative fixes, the application currently fails to load correctly, exhibiting a **404 Not Found** on the root page and runtime JavaScript errors in the server logs.

Specifically, the errors observed are:
1.  ****: This indicates an issue with Supabase's client attempting to access cookies, likely stemming from a mismatch or conflict between server-side ( ) and client-side cookie handling mechanisms. This suggests an incompatibility with how Supabase SSR is configured or used within the Next.js App Router environment.
2.  ****: This error points to a failure in Supabase's automatic session refresh mechanism, contributing to the broader session persistence issues.

The root cause appears to be an incompatible Supabase Server-Side Rendering (SSR) configuration. The AI engineer has just attempted to fix this by simplifying the Supabase client configuration in  and restarting the server, but the problem persists. The application's core functionality (signup, role selection, onboarding) cannot be fully tested or utilized until these foundational authentication and session issues are resolved. The system is currently in a broken state due to these underlying configuration conflicts.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue debugging the Supabase SSR configuration to resolve the  and  errors, which are causing the application's 404s.

I found the issue! There are **multiple Supabase-related errors**: 1. - This is a cookie storage issue 2. - Session refresh is failing 3. The app is showing 404 because of these JavaScript errors The problem is the **Supabase SSR configuration is incompatible** with our setup. Let me fix this by simplifying the Supabase client:. (Message 330)
I can see the Supabase SSR errors are still happening. Let me restart the server to load the fix: (Message 332)
