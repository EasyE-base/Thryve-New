The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the Thryve fitness platform, transitioning it from an MVP to a robust, feature-rich application. Initial efforts focused on foundational stability, including Firebase Auth migration, UI enhancements, and critical Kubernetes ingress routing fixes. Subsequent work implemented complex business logic like no-show fees and X-Pass, followed by the successful parallel deployment and testing of notification, analytics, and file upload systems. Significant progress was made on the Instructor Staffing & Shift Swap System, though an authentication flow issue persisted. The AI-Powered Recommendation Engine was fully implemented.

The most recent work phases involved addressing critical bugs and implementing new features. The engineer successfully fixed a multi-faceted onboarding bug, ensuring correct studio name display, real data population, and an improved UI/UX. Following this, a runtime error in the class creation form was resolved. A persistent authentication/authorization issue for studio owners was then tackled, leading to the development of debugging tools and resolution of role-based access problems. A major initiative was the comprehensive removal of all hardcoded data across dashboards and marketplace, replacing them with real database integrations. Performance bottlenecks in the onboarding flow were identified and optimized for speed. The latest task involved creating essential footer pages (Help Center, Contact Us, Community, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy), with the immediate next step being to fix their non-functional links.

<product_requirements>
The Thryve project aims to build a comprehensive multi-role fitness platform (Customer, Instructor, Merchant) focusing on a seamless user experience. The initial core problem was establishing a scalable foundation, addressed with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Firebase Auth. Core business logic includes No-Show/Late Cancellation Fees, Thryve X Pass (multi-studio credit), diverse Pricing Models (transaction fees, business tiers), and Unlimited Product Billing Cycles. Recently, the **Instructor Staffing & Schedule Management** system was introduced, enabling shift coverage, real-time communication, and instructor swaps with optional studio approval and conflict detection. The latest strategic vision is the **AI Studio Onboarding & Growth Assistant**, designed to eliminate onboarding friction and provide intelligent growth recommendations. This includes an AI-powered data importer for seamless migration, an AI configuration wizard for quick setup, an AI-driven website builder, customer migration intelligence, an ongoing AI growth coach, and AI-powered class optimization. The application also requires standard web pages like Help Center, Contact Us, Community, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on creating several static content pages for the application footer. The user provided basic HTML snippets for **Help Center, Contact Us, Community, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy** pages. The AI engineer successfully created dedicated Next.js pages for each of these in the  directory, styling them to match the existing Thryve website's aesthetic, incorporating modern UI elements, and populating them with placeholder legal/support content and social links.

Specifically, the following new files were created:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

These pages were designed with consistent branding, interactive elements where appropriate (like contact forms, cookie toggles), and professional content. The  was updated implicitly for any new component dependencies (e.g., Lucide React icons).

The very last user interaction () reported that Clicking all these links do nothing, indicating that while the pages themselves have been created, the actual navigation links (presumably in a footer component, not explicitly shown or created in the trajectory as a separate file) are not yet wired up or are incorrectly configured. The AI engineer has acknowledged this () and is about to investigate and fix the footer component to ensure these newly created pages are accessible.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the non-functional footer links to connect them to the newly created static content pages.
