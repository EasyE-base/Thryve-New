# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

##     -message: "COMPLETED: COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-ROLE ONBOARDING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION - Successfully implemented a complete onboarding infrastructure for the Thryve fitness platform. Key achievements: 1) Integrated OnboardingProvider into main application layout for global state management, 2) Created missing infrastructure components (OnboardingLayout, OnboardingSteps, ProgressBar) for consistent UX, 3) Enhanced Customer onboarding (already advanced 4-step flow), 4) Completely rebuilt Instructor onboarding from basic 3-step to comprehensive 5-step professional flow with certifications, teaching preferences, verification, and payment setup, 5) Completely rebuilt Merchant onboarding from basic 3-step to advanced 6-step business setup with facility details, policies, staff management, pricing models, and legal compliance. All onboarding flows now use the OnboardingProvider infrastructure with advanced features like step validation, progress tracking, localStorage backup, API integration, and welcome tours. Ready for backend testing to ensure all API endpoints work correctly."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Testing shows signup forms work but role selection fails due to persistent API 502 errors, preventing users from completing authentication and accessing any protected pages including My Bookings. ❌ USER JOURNEY BROKEN: The complete user journey from signup → role selection → onboarding → My Bookings access is broken at the role selection step due to infrastructure API routing issues. ❌ TESTING LIMITATION: Cannot test the actual My Bookings functionality (booking display, search, tabs, actions) because the authentication prerequisite cannot be satisfied. CONCLUSION: The My Bookings frontend is properly implemented but completely unusable due to authentication flow blocking issues. This is consistent with previous reports of API 502 errors preventing role selection completion."

The reported error occurs when: 1) User profile doesn't exist in database, 2) User has role other than 'merchant', or 3) Profile lookup fails.

COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION: All three role selection flows tested with multiple user accounts. Firebase authentication working perfectly with proper signup/signin functionality. Role selection screen displays correctly after successful signup. LocalStorage cleanup and stale data handling mechanisms are functioning properly. Loading states and timeout delays are implemented correctly to prevent race conditions. Fallback mechanisms work when API calls fail due to 502 infrastructure issues. INFRASTRUCTURE NOTE: While API calls still return 502 errors due to external URL routing issues, the application gracefully handles these errors using localStorage fallback, allowing users to complete the role selection and onboarding flow successfully. The role selection routing logic has been completely fixed and is working as designed. FINAL ASSESSMENT: The role selection routing bug that was causing Customer clicks to redirect to instructor onboarding has been completely resolved.
